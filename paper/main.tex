\begin{abstract}
\noindent
The emergence of decentralized artificial intelligence networks presents fundamental challenges in establishing trust and verifiability across distributed computing nodes. This paper provides a comprehensive technical analysis of Trusted Execution Environments as a foundational security mechanism for decentralized AI systems, with particular focus on the Sentient Enclaves Framework built upon AWS Nitro Enclaves. We examine the complete architecture of TEE technologies, including process-based implementations like Intel SGX and virtual machine-based solutions such as AWS Nitro Enclaves, AMD SEV-SNP, and Intel TDX. Through detailed cryptographic analysis of attestation mechanisms utilizing CBOR and COSE standards, we demonstrate how hardware-enforced isolation enables verifiable computation in trustless environments. Our performance evaluation reveals that modern TEE implementations impose only 10 to 25 percent computational overhead while providing strong security guarantees for AI model protection and inference privacy. We analyze the integration of TEE-based systems with blockchain smart contracts for decentralized node verification, examining gas optimization strategies and economic security models. The paper addresses critical security considerations including implicit trust relationships in pre-compiled binaries, PCR computation vulnerabilities, and the centralized trust dependency on cloud providers. We explore advanced architectures combining TEEs with multi-party computation for enhanced decentralization, evaluate regulatory compliance frameworks including GDPR and HIPAA requirements, and identify open research directions in post-quantum cryptography adaptation and cross-platform attestation protocols. Our analysis demonstrates that TEE technology provides a practical foundation for deploying verifiable AI systems in decentralized networks, particularly for models in the 7 billion to 13 billion parameter range, while highlighting operational challenges in certificate management and the need for automated infrastructure. This work contributes to the growing body of research on confidential computing for artificial intelligence and provides actionable insights for practitioners building trustless AI systems.
